# taproot is a free, open-source "link-in-bio" website
taproot can be used to create beautiful landing pages for your brand that are completely under your control.
no subscriptions. no ads. just links! check out an example [right here](https://brianlaclair.github.io/taproot)

## how do i use it?
taproot is 100% client-facing, meaning it can be hosted anywhere. everything about your taproot site is controlled by the config.json file which can be edited manually, or with the [builder tool](https://brianlaclair.github.io/taproot/builder/).

the easiest way to start using taproot is by:
1. forking this repository
2. utilizing [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your newly forked version
3. design your page with the builder tool
4. replace the config.json file in your repository with the one downloaded from the builder

#### in-depth visual guides are coming soon!

## future features
- options for analytics (integrating with existing analytics solutions, as well as free options)
- upgraded builder tool
- more control of default style
- additional default social media link options
- per-link styling
- additional types of links
